This folder contains pieces of code that I wrote for testing if the matrix generation, 

middle instruction and separate versions of exp work.

ExperimentCode_CCL_CL.py is the original script that administrates non-control CL version.

ExperimentCode_CCL_C.py is the original script that administrates control CL version.

instr_test.py is for testing how to add middle instruction when moving to the second version.

matrix.py generates exp matrix for each sub, might use later.
